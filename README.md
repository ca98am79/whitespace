# Whitespace

Whitespace is an esoteric imperative stack-based language.

Here I am trying to write a whitespace interpreter in javascript. There isn't much to see right now, but more to come soon.

For more information and the reference implementation, see [the official website](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/).

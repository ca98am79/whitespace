# Whitespace

Whitespace is an esoteric imperative stack-based language.

Here I am trying to write a whitespace interpreter in javascript. The lexer and the parser are pretty much done, the VM is on it's way.
I still need to figure out some things from the original Haskell source.

For more information and the reference implementation, see [the official website](http://compsoc.dur.ac.uk/whitespace/).

# Whitespace

Whitespace is an esoteric imperative stack-based language made by two guys who had too much time on their hands.

Here I am trying to write a whitespace interpreter in javascript.

All the programs in `ws` should work fine.

## Run

You can simply run it with:
```
$ node index.js file.ws
```

Or you can see the compiled bytecode:
```
$ node index.js debug file.ws
```

# Whitespace

Whitespace is an esoteric imperative stack-based language made by two guys who had too much time on their hands.

Here I am trying to write a whitespace interpreter in javascript.

Most of the programs in the `ws` directory are working. There is a problem with name.ws, I will look at it soon.

**Note**: Every program that waits for an input does not work on MAC OS X. Still need to find a workaround...

## Run

You can simply run it with:
```
$ node index.js file.ws
```

Or you can see the compiled bytecode:
```
$ node index.js debug file.ws
```
